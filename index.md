Hello! My name is Chrsitine Salaysay. 



Note: I wrote this short bio to go with a recent journal publication where I was co-editor. On my personal website this bio is much shorter. Writing this bio (or abstract) is not easy, most people rewrite it very often before they consider it final for a specific purpose. So should you. Experiment and ask for feedback.

## social media links
- [LinkedIn](
- [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/christinetorreliza/)

Note: only link social media that you are happy for people to visit i.e. if your website gives information about a professional service, you should not link it to your social media account which is primarily for your personal use.
