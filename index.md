## Eleanor Piller
  
**Second Year Student studying Liberal Arts**

Hello! My name is Eleanor Piller and I am a second year student studying Liberal Arts at the University of Essex. I am studying Liberal Arts to gain better general knowledge and have a broader, wide range of further education. I currently run my own beauty business, where I specialise in Eyelash Lift and Tint and Brow Wax and Tint as a side hustle whilst I am studying at university, this enables me to still study whilst making some money. However, In the future I would like to work in fashion and possibly have my own business.
My studies at the university will help me in the future with my passion for getting into the fashion industry due to it expanding a lot of my skills. Such as my confidence, communication, technology advancements and research skills to name a few.

## My Intrests
I have a strong passion for dance. I have been dancing since I was two and enjoy it thoroughly, it has helped me develop new skills and build my confidence by performing in front of lots of people. I am currently at University where I am studying Liberal Arts. Doing this I have developed more knowledge and writing skills to a much higher level, and also I have developed more confidence by meeting new people at Uni. I enjoy reading and have done it for a long time, this has helped widen my knowledge of different topics and has also introduced me to lots of different words and opinions that I have taken on board and have brought into my own life. Once a month, I help at my local church at the Fellowship teas. I make tea and give out cake and treats to the elders that go. This gives me a chance to speak to lots of different people and is very interesting. I have a passion for fashion and my dream is to have my own fashion business in the future.

## Fashion
I have a dream of owning my own business in the future in the fashion industry. I have wanted to work in fashion for a very long time, however, due to it being such a difficult industry to get into I decided to do a degree to widen my knowledge and also give me more opportunities in the future if I am unable to work in fashion. I have social media pages where I post outfits and looks I have come up with, to begin to showcase what I am doing. After university, I am hoping to get an internship or job in the fashion industry whilst working on my own designs and styles on the side. I will hope to gain knowledge in the industry so I can hope to develop my own business. I know that it is such a difficult industry to work in so I have made plans for what I could do in the future if I am unable to work, however, I am hoping that will not be the case.
