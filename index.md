**Student in Univeristy of Essex**  

Kamusta? My name is Chrsitine Salaysay. I'm a first year student studying Psychology at the University of Essex. I'm currently employed with three part-time jobs. It can be tough at times, but it helped me shape the person I am now. Iâ€™m interested in travelling and meeting new people from different walks of life. It gives me purpose and a chance to explore whilst getting to know the world better. I also enjoy posting stuff on internet, specifically instagram. I consider it as my playground to release the creativity inside me.
