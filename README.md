A link in the sidebar will take you to the one-pager website, which is the 'index.md.' file. I have included my personal and professional CV, where you can learn more about who I am personally nad professionally. 

A PDF of my essay will be uploaded to faser.

## TODO
•	Start your IT - use your GitHub
•	Update your public repository once a week
•	Start with:
      Reading the template - adding notes 
      Start working with my private repository

•	Go back to main repository and check digital identity - look at the generations; culture differences 

•	Work on your essay - where do I come from? 
•	Watch videos 
•	What’s the most interesting part in the video that you’ve moved by
    -  “This is what I want to explore/articulate”

•	Go through the resources - a guide 

•	Do some research on the internet 

•	Familiarise yourself with the GitHub

<br>

# Additional notes
•	Portfolio website is like your CV
•	Website clarification: easiest - short/simple project website / portfolio website - can feature multiple project website 
•	Use your real name for the website links

# Project management
e.g. readme file - log in (make you think clearly in a systematic way)

*consider this as a way of working 

Goal: improve your identity use on the web
show it to people in a concise way 

	•	move to development stage
	•	gantt chart
	•	make a plan 

-> main tools to use your di-identity essay / website

-> look at people’s website, markdown, use pen and paper
use diff tools so our brain works in a diff way

*physical notebook*

-> take diff audios and put them on the software (jingle - sound design)
